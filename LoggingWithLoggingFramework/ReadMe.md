# Logging with a Logging Framework (using Serilog as an example)
This repository provides code examples and guidance for implementing logging in C# applications using the Serilog logging framework. Logging is an essential aspect of software development, as it helps developers track application behavior, identify issues, and debug problems effectively.

## Code Example: Logging with Serilog
The code example below demonstrates how to configure and use Serilog to log exceptions in a C# application.
```
using System;
using Serilog;

// Configure the Serilog logger
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    //.WriteTo.Console()
    .WriteTo.File("log.txt", rollingInterval: RollingInterval.Day)
    .CreateLogger();

try
{
    // Some code that may throw an exception
    int numerator = 10;
    int denominator = 0;
    int result = numerator / denominator; // This will throw a DivideByZeroException
    Console.WriteLine($"Result: {result}");
}
catch (DivideByZeroException ex)
{
    // Handle the exception gracefully
    Console.WriteLine("An error occurred: Cannot divide by zero.");
    // Log the exception using the configured logger
    Log.Error(ex, "An error occurred: Cannot divide by zero.");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Handle any other unexpected exceptions
    Console.WriteLine("An unexpected error occurred.");
    // Log the exception using the configured logger
    Log.Error(ex, "An unexpected error occurred.");
}
finally
{
    // Close and flush the logger to ensure all log messages are written before the application exits
    Log.CloseAndFlush();
}
```
In the code above, we first configure the Serilog logger to write log messages to a file named "log.txt" with a rolling interval of one day. By default, Serilog will also write log messages to the console, but it is commented out in this example. You can enable console logging by uncommenting the .WriteTo.Console() line.

Next, we have a try-catch block where we attempt to perform a division operation that may throw a DivideByZeroException. In the catch blocks, we handle the exceptions gracefully by printing error messages to the console and logging the exceptions using the configured Serilog logger with the Log.Error() method.

Finally, in the finally block, we close and flush the logger to ensure all log messages are written to the file before the application exits.

## Security Considerations
When using a logging framework, it is crucial to handle sensitive information carefully. Avoid logging sensitive data such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal identifiable information (PII) to prevent potential data breaches.

Ensure that the log files are stored securely, and access to the log files is restricted to authorized personnel only.
