# Encrypting Sensitive Data using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
This repository provides code examples and guidance on how to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in C#. The provided code demonstrates how to securely encrypt sensitive data with AES encryption and later decrypt it.

## Code Example
The C# code provided below shows how to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data using AES.
```
// Sample sensitive data to be encrypted
using EncryptingSensitiveDataUsingAES;

string sensitiveData = "This is my sensitive data.";

// Encrypt the sensitive data
string encryptedData = Security.EncryptAES(sensitiveData, "yourEncryptionKey");

// Decrypt the encrypted data (for demonstration purposes)
string decryptedData = Security.DecryptAES(encryptedData, "yourEncryptionKey");

// Output the results
Console.WriteLine($"Original Data: {sensitiveData}");
Console.WriteLine($"Encrypted Data: {encryptedData}");
Console.WriteLine($"Decrypted Data: {decryptedData}");
```
The EncryptAES method in the Security class takes the sensitive data and an encryption key as input and returns the encrypted data as a Base64 encoded string. The DecryptAES method decrypts the encrypted data back to its original form using the same encryption key.

## Security Considerations
### Encryption Key Management
Ensure that the encryption key is securely managed and not hardcoded in the code. Store the key securely, such as using Azure Key Vault or other secure storage solutions.

### Data Protection
Use encryption only for sensitive data that needs protection, such as passwords, personal information, or any confidential data.

### Key Generation
Generate strong encryption keys using a cryptographically secure random number generator.

### Secure Key Sharing
If multiple parties need to decrypt the data, use secure mechanisms to share the encryption key only with authorized parties.

### Proper Key Rotation
Implement a key rotation strategy to periodically change encryption keys to enhance security.
