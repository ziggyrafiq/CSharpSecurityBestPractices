# Secure Session Management with Native C#
This repository provides code examples and guidance for implementing secure session management in native C# applications. Secure session management is essential to maintain user sessions securely, preventing unauthorized access and session hijacking.

## Code Example: Secure Session Management in Native C#
The following code demonstrates how to implement secure session management in a native C# application.
```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace SecureSessionManagementNative
{
    public static class Security
    {
        private static readonly Dictionary<string, object> SessionData = new Dictionary<string, object>();

        public static void StoreSessionData<T>(string sessionId, string key, T value)
        {
            // Store the session data securely (you might use a more secure storage mechanism in a real application)
            SessionData[$"{sessionId}_{key}"] = value;
        }

        public static T RetrieveSessionData<T>(string sessionId, string key)
        {
            // Retrieve and return the session data securely
            if (SessionData.TryGetValue($"{sessionId}_{key}", out object value) && value is T typedValue)
            {
                return typedValue;
            }

            return default(T);
        }

        public static void ClearSessionData(string sessionId)
        {
            // Clear the session data after session expiration or when the user logs out
            // In this example, we are using a Dictionary, but you might use a more suitable data store for a real application
            SessionData.Clear();
        }
    }
}
```
## Usage Example
```
// Sample user data (you might get this from authentication)
int userId = 123;
string username = "john_doe";

// Generate a unique session ID (you might use a more robust method in a real application)
string sessionId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();

// Store session data securely (avoid storing sensitive data in the session)
Security.StoreSessionData(sessionId, "UserId", userId);
Security.StoreSessionData(sessionId, "Username", username);

// Retrieve session data (you can do this for each request)
int storedUserId = Security.RetrieveSessionData<int>(sessionId, "UserId");
string storedUsername = Security.RetrieveSessionData<string>(sessionId, "Username");

// Perform actions using the retrieved session data
Console.WriteLine($"User ID: {storedUserId}, Username: {storedUsername}");

// Clear the session after it expires or when the user logs out
Security.ClearSessionData(sessionId);
```

## Security Considerations
* The session data in this example is stored in a Dictionary, which is not suitable for a production environment. In a real application, you should use a more secure data store, such as a database or a distributed cache.
* Ensure that sensitive session data is stored securely and not exposed to unauthorized users or external threats.
* Consider implementing a session expiration mechanism to automatically clear expired session data to free up resources and prevent session hijacking.
