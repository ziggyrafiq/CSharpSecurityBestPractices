# Input Sanitization (Preventing XSS)
This repository provides code examples and guidance for implementing input sanitization in C# to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. XSS is a common security vulnerability where malicious code is injected into web applications, allowing attackers to steal sensitive user data or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of users.

## Code Example: Sanitizing User Input
In the code example below, we demonstrate how to sanitize user input using HTML encoding to prevent XSS attacks.
```
using System;
using System.Web;

Console.Write("Enter your comment: ");
string inputComment = Console.ReadLine();

// Sanitize user input using HTML encoding
string sanitizedComment = HttpUtility.HtmlEncode(inputComment);

// Store the sanitized comment in the database or display it on a web page
Console.WriteLine($"Sanitized Comment: {sanitizedComment}");
```
In the code above, we prompt the user to enter a comment, and the inputComment variable stores the user's input. To prevent XSS attacks, we use HttpUtility.HtmlEncode() to encode any HTML tags or special characters in the user input. This process converts potentially dangerous characters into their corresponding HTML entities, ensuring that the input is safe to be displayed on a web page or stored in a database.

## Security Considerations
Input sanitization is an essential practice to prevent XSS attacks, but it should not be the sole defense. Always use input validation to ensure that user input conforms to expected formats and reject any input that could be malicious.

Additionally, when displaying the sanitized input on a web page, use appropriate content security policies (CSP) to further mitigate XSS risks.
