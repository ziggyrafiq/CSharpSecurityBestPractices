# Avoiding Dynamic Code Execution with User Input
This repository provides a code example and guidelines on how to avoid dynamic code execution with user input in C#. Dynamic code execution with untrusted input can lead to serious security vulnerabilities, such as code injection attacks. The provided code demonstrates how to safely handle user input when launching processes using the System.Diagnostics namespace.

## Code Example
The C# code provided below illustrates how to avoid direct dynamic code execution with user input.
```
using System.Diagnostics;

// Sample user input (this could come from a user input field in a web application)
string userInput = "calc.exe";

// Avoid executing dynamic code constructed with user input directly
// In this example, we launch a process based on the user input, but this should be avoided with untrusted input
Process.Start(userInput);
```
In this example, the Process.Start method is used to launch a process based on the user input userInput. However, executing dynamic code directly with untrusted input can pose a significant security risk.

## Security Considerations
### Avoid Direct Code Execution
Refrain from executing user-provided input directly as code, especially when dealing with untrusted input. Performing so may result in code injection vulnerabilities.

### Input Validation and Sanitization
Always validate and sanitize user inputs before using them in any code execution or processing. Implement proper validation mechanisms to ensure only expected input is accepted.

### Use Whitelisting Approach
If necessary, consider using a whitelist approach, where specific allowed inputs are predefined, and only those inputs are accepted and executed.

### Minimize Privileges
When executing processes, ensure that they run with the minimum required privileges to limit potential damages in case of exploitation.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve and expand the code examples are welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests with enhancements or bug fixes.
