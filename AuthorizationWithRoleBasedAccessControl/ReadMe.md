# Authorization with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
This repository contains code examples and guidance for implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in C#. The provided code demonstrates how to check if a user is authorized to access a specific resource based on their role.

## Code Example
The C# code provided below checks if a user is authorized to access a specific resource (e.g., "AdminPanel") based on their role:
```// Sample user data (you would get this from a database or identity provider)
string username = "john_doe";
string userRole = "admin"; // User's role (admin, user, etc.)

// Check if the user is authorized to access a specific resource (e.g., "AdminPanel")
if (CheckAccess.IsAuthorized(username, userRole, "AdminPanel"))
{
    Console.WriteLine("Access granted! User is authorized.");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Access denied! User is not authorized.");
}

namespace AuthorizationWithRoleBasedAccessControl
{
    public static class CheckAccess
    {
        public static bool IsAuthorized(string username, string userRole, string resource)
        {
            // In a real application, you would likely have a more robust authorization mechanism
            // Here, we simply check if the user is an "admin" to grant access to the "AdminPanel" resource
            if (userRole.Equals("admin") && resource.Equals("AdminPanel"))
            {
                return true;
            }

            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

The CheckAccess.IsAuthorized method in the AuthorizationWithRoleBasedAccessControl.CheckAccess class checks if the user is authorized to access the specified resource based on their role. In this example, we have a simple check that grants access to the "AdminPanel" resource only if the user's role is "admin."

## Security Considerations
1. In a production application, you would implement a more robust and fine-grained authorization mechanism, such as using a database to store user roles and associated permissions.
2. Ensure that sensitive role information is securely stored and managed to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation.
3. Regularly review and update role assignments and permissions to maintain an appropriate level of access control.
