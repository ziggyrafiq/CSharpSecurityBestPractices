# Secure Password Storage with Salted Hashing
This repository provides code examples and guidance for securely storing user passwords using salted hashing in C# applications. Passwords are a critical aspect of security, and proper password storage is essential to protect user accounts from unauthorized access.

## Code Example: Secure Password Storage with Salted Hashing
The code example below demonstrates how to securely store user passwords using salted hashing.
```
using System;
using System.Security.Cryptography;

// Sample password provided by the user (you would get this from a registration or login form)
using SecurePasswordStorageWithSaltedHashing;

string userPassword = "MyStrongPassword123";

// Generate a random salt (unique for each user)
byte[] salt = Security.GenerateSalt();

// Hash the password with the salt
string hashedPassword = Security.HashPassword(userPassword, salt);

// In a real application, you would store 'hashedPassword' and 'salt' in the database
// When the user attempts to login, you'll retrieve the 'salt' from the database and
// recompute the hashed password for the login attempt to compare it with the stored one.
```
The Security class in the SecurePasswordStorageWithSaltedHashing namespace contains methods to generate a random salt and hash the user's password using PBKDF2 with SHA-256 as the hashing algorithm.

## Security Considerations
* Never store passwords in plain text or using weak hashing mechanisms (e.g., MD5, SHA-1). Always use strong and slow hashing algorithms like PBKDF2, bcrypt, or Argon2.

*  Each user should have a unique salt. Generating a random salt for each user adds an extra layer of protection against rainbow table attacks.

*  The number of iterations in the hashing process (10000 in this example) should be set high enough to make brute-force attacks computationally expensive.

* The length of the salt and hash should be adjusted based on the requirements of your application.

* Ensure that the salt and hashedPassword are securely stored in the database. Access to this information should be restricted to authorized personnel only.
